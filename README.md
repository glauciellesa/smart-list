## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run dev
```

This command starts your project in development mode using Vite. It's perfect for actively working on your project, as it enables hot module replacement (HMR), meaning your changes will instantly appear in the browser without the need for manual refreshing. You can access your development server at [http://localhost:5174/](http://localhost:5174/).

```
npm run build
```

Use this command to build your project for production. It optimizes and bundles your code, ensuring the best performance. The result will be placed in the "build" directory, ready for deployment.

```
npm run preview
```

Running this command will start a local server to preview your production build. It's useful for testing your build locally before deploying it to a live server. You can typically access the preview at [http://localhost:4173/](http://localhost:4173/) or another port specified in the output.

```
npm start
```

Similar to `npm run dev`, this command starts your project using Vite. It's often used when you want to quickly run your project without any special development features. You can access it at [http://localhost:5176/](http://localhost:5176/).

Please replace `npm` with `yarn` if you are using Yarn as your package manager.
